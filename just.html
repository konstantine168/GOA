<body><i>Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო, romanized: sakartvelo, IPA:<br> 
[sakʰartʰʷelo] ⓘ) is a transcontinental country in Eastern Europe[10][11][12] and West Asia. It is part of the Caucasus region, bounded by<br> 
the Black Sea to the west, Russia to the north and northeast, Turkey to the southwest, Armenia to the south, and Azerbaijan to the southeast.<br> 
Georgia covers an area of 69,700 square kilometres (26,900 sq mi).[13] It has a population of 3.7 million,[b][14] of which over a third<br> 
live in the capital and largest city, Tbilisi. Georgians, who are native to the region, constitute a majority of the country's population<br> 
and are its titular nation.<br> 
Georgia has been inhabited since prehistory, hosting the world's earliest<br> 
known sites of winemaking, gold mining, and textiles.[15][16] The classical era saw the emergence of several kingdoms, such<br> 
as Colchis and Iberia, that formed the nucleus of the modern Georgian state. In the early fourth century, Georgians officially<br> 
adopted Christianity, which contributed to the unification into the Kingdom of Georgia. Georgia reached its Golden Age during<br> 
the High Middle Ages under the reigns of King David IV and Queen Tamar. Beginning in the 15th century, the kingdom declined<br> 
and disintegrated under pressure from various regional powers, including the Mongols, the Ottoman Empire, and Persia, before<br> 
being gradually annexed into the Russian Empire starting in 1801.<br>

After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Georgia briefly emerged as an independent<br> 
republic under German protection,[17] but was invaded and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1922, becoming one of its constituent republics. In the<br> 
1980s, an independence movement grew quickly, leading to Georgia's secession from the Soviet Union in April 1991. For much of the subsequent<br> 
decade, the country endured economic crises, political instability,<br> 
and secessionist wars in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Following the peaceful Rose Revolution in 2003,<br> 
Georgia strongly pursued a pro-Western foreign policy, introducing a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at<br> 
integration into the European Union and NATO. This Western orientation led to worsening relations with Russia, culminating<br> 
in the Russo-Georgian War of 2008 and continued Russian occupation of parts of Georgia.<br>

Georgia is a representative democracy governed as a unitary parliamentary republic.[18][19]<br> 
It is a developing country with a very high Human Development Index and an emerging market economy. Sweeping economic<br> 
reforms since 2003 have resulted in one of the freest business climates in the world, greater economic freedom and transparency, and among<br> 
the fastest rates of GDP growth.[20] In 2018, Georgia became the second country<br> 
in the world to legalize cannabis, and the first former socialist state to do so. Georgia is a member of numerous international organizations,<br> 
including the Council of Europe, Eurocontrol, BSEC, GUAM, Energy Community. As part of the Association Trio, Georgia is a candidate<br> 
for membership in the European Union.[21]</i><br> 
<h1>EMYTOLOGY</h1><br>
<i>Ancient Greeks (Strabo, Herodotus, Plutarch, Homer, etc.) and Romans (Titus Livius, Tacitus, etc.) referred to early<br> 
western Georgians as Colchians and eastern Georgians as Iberians (Iberoi, Ἰβηροι in some Greek sources).[22]<br> 
The first mention of the name Georgia is in Italian on the mappa mundi of Pietro Vesconte dated 1320.<br> 
[23] <ins>At the early stage of its appearance in the Latin world, the name was often spelled Jorgia.</ins>[24] Lore-based t-<br> 
heories were given by traveler Jacques de Vitry, who explained the name's origin by the popularity of St. George among Georgians,[25] while<br> 
Jean Chardin thought that Georgia came from the Greek γεωργός ('tiller of the land'). These centuries-old explanations<br> 
for the word Georgia/Georgians are now mostly rejected by the scholarly community, who point to the Persian word gurğ/gurğān (گرگ,<br> 
'wolf'[26]) as the likely root of the word.[27] Under this<br> 
hypothesis, the same Persian root was later adopted in numerous other languages, including Slavic and West European languages.[27][28]<br> 
The native name is Sakartvelo <mark>(საქართველო;</mark> 'land of Kartvelians'), derived<br> 
from the core central Georgian region of Kartli, recorded from the 9th century, and in extended<br> 
usage referring to the entire medieval Kingdom of Georgia prior to the 13th century. The Georgian<br> 
circumfix sa-X-o is a standard geographic construction designating 'the area where X dwell', where<br> 
X is an ethnonym.[29] The self-designation used by ethnic Georgians<br> 
is Kartvelebi (ქართველები, i.e. 'Kartvelians'), first attested in the Umm Leisun inscription found in the Old City of Jerusalem.<br> 
The medieval Georgian Chronicles present an eponymous ancestor of the Kartvelians, Kartlos, a great-grandson of Japheth who medieval<br> 
chroniclers believed to have been the root of the local name of their kingdom. However,<br> 
scholars agree that the word Kartli is derived from the Karts, a proto-Kartvelian tribe that emerged<br> 
as a dominant regional group in ancient times.[27] The name Sakartvelo (საქართველო) consists of two<br> 
parts. Its root, kartvel-i <mark>(ქართველ-ი),</mark> specifies an<br> 
inhabitant of the core central-eastern Georgian region of Kartli, or Iberia as it is known in sources of the Eastern Roman Empire.[30]</i></body>
