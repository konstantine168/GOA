#lets learn float
#a float is an integer but it,s a full number 
#EXAMPLE
#int 1 float 1.5
#what will pop up on the terminal?
math = 5/2
print(math)
#now make 3 out of sawing six in half 
math = 6/2
print(math)
#well done now 
#lets saw 15!
math = 15/2
print(math)
#comment zone
#I like all of the lessons
#it,s funny and intresting
#I love coding
#now saw 20 to 10 30 to 15 and 40 to 20
math = 20/10
print(math)
#nice
math = 30/2
print(math)
#perfection
40/2
print(math)
#done for now!
#sucsesfully learned float!
#good job!
