#this time we will debugging + integers
#can you spot the bugs?
math = 32
math2 = 64
print(math + math2)

#now what will come up on the screen?
math = 32
math2 = 450
print("483")
#done!
#what is the integer here?
#also theres a bug here
h123 = 333
h123 = 3331
print(h123)
#looks like you learned integers!
#comment time!
#it,s hard but very intresting!
