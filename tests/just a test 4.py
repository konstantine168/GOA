#lets learn integers!
#an integer is anytype of number exept the ones with dots we will learn that later
#lets make 15 out of integers!
#EXAMPLE
math_1 = 7
math_2 = 8
print(math_1 + math_2)
#now lets make 9 out of three integers 
#EXAMPLE
math_1 = 3
math_2 = 3
math_3 = 3
print(math_1 + math_2 + math_3)
#see it isn,t like the strings where you have to type str(example)it,s youre free!
#now make 16 out of fours
math_1 = 4
math_2 = 4
math_3 = 4
math_4 = 4 
print(math_1 + math_2 + math_3 + math_4)
#good job you learned integers!
